You are in the Arboretum.  This location houses all non-
sentient organic life on the ship. There are various plants and animals 
present, but the recent ship malfunctions have caused many of the plants 
to die and the animals are slowly starving as well. 

You notice a Turtle and Crops. 

To the West is the Mess Hall.
