You are in the Medical Bay. This area has all of the ship's medical apparatus and supplies. None of that stuff seems used. You yell, "WHAT HAPPENED HERE?" And a strange Dying Alien telepathically tells you, "Figure it out." Right beside him are Alien Notes.

After you make your decision on what to do, you remember you can go back to the Crew Quarters in the North or forge West to the Forward Observation Lounge.
