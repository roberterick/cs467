You are in the Medical Bay. This area has all of the 
ship's medical apparatus and supplies. None of that stuff seems used. 
You yell, "WHAT HAPPENED HERE?" And a strange Dying Alien telepathically 
tells you, "Figure it out." Right beside him are Alien Notes.  An 
Android, and an Oxygen Tank catch your eye.

After you make your decision on what to do, you remember you can go 
back to the Crew Quarters in the North or head West to Forward Observation.
