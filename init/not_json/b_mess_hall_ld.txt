You dash to the Mess Hall while contemplating why you're 
stuck here. You're shocked by what you notice first: a Dying Man who 
appears to be distressed. Right beside him is an ElevatorKey2. 

You hate to admit, but you also start thinking about food. You see that 
there's Leftovers on the stove. There's also some Lettuce right by it.

In case you're wondering, to the East is an Arboretum and to the West is 
the Crew Quarters.
