You dash to the Mess Hall while contemplating why you're stuck here. You're shocked by what you notice first: a Dying Man who appears to be distressed. Right beside him is an ElevatorKey2. 

You hate to admit, but you also start thinking about food. You see that there's Leftovers on the stove. There's also some Lettuce right by it.

In case you're wondering, to the East is an Arboretum and to the West is the Crew Quarters.
