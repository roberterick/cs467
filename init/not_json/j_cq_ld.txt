You walk slowly through the Crew Quarters. There's no one here unfortunately. There are also no windows. You notice a sign that says, "GET THE MEDALLIONS!" Do you think you should follow it? 

As you look around, you notice a Diary by someone's bunkbed. There's a fresh pair of Pajamas on the ground. 

A shiver goes up your spine, and you look around for ways to get out of here. To the North there's a Captain's Cabin. From the East, you smell food in the Mess Hall. You hear a strange sound coming from the South--that's the Medical Bay (and goodies). You can also go West to the Elevator Level 2.
