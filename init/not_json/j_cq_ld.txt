You walk slowly through the Crew Quarters. There's no one 
here unfortunately. There are also no windows. As you look around, you 
notice a Diary by someone's bunkbed. There's a fresh pair of Pajamas on 
the ground. You notice a Multitool sitting on a footlocker.

A shiver goes up your spine, and you look around for ways to get out of 
here. To the North there's a Captain's Cabin. From the East, you smell 
food in the Mess Hall. You hear a strange sound coming from the South--
that's the Medical Bay (and goodies). You can also go West to the 
Elevator Level 2.
