You are in the bridge elevator. The display says 'level 1'. It doesn't seem like it has been used in a long time. You notice that there's a Keyhole1 and a Directory1 near the elevator control panel. 

When you look North, you see the Bridge. You also notice that you might be able to go Down to Elevator Level 2.
