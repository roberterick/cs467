Congratulations on gaining access to level 2 of the 
bridge elevator. As the elevator creeps down, the display slowly switches
to 'level 2'. Also, the control panel now has a Keyhole2 and a Directory2. 

You can go Up back to Elevator Level 1 or you can try going East to the 
Crew Quarters. Finally, you notice that the control panel notes that 
going Down leads you to Elevator level 3.
