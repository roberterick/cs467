You enter the Forward Observation Lounge, this used to 
be a place to relax and view the stars while not on duty.  The room is 
only lit by emergency lights.  Power must have been cut off from all 
non-essential systems. As you look around the room, an 
Entertainmet Terminal and a Table of Notes catches your eye. There's also
a Telescope near a window.

You can go East to the Medical Bay.
