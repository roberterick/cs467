You enter the Forward Observation Lounge and ponder why this room exists when there's already a bridge...

As you scavenge around, a Table of Notes catches your eye. There's also a Telescope near a window here. Lastly, your eyes gaze on the Silver Medallion.

You can go East to the Medical Bay after you're done here.
